I offer academic consulting, private tutoring, and university application support across the physical sciences. The best approach is usually to get in touch and we can discuss what would be most useful for you.

### Tailored PhD application support

I have experience providing tailored guidance for students applying to PhD programmes in the UK, with particular experience in **Oxbridge science-based PhD applications**.

This can include:
- advice on choosing supervisors and projects.
- feedback on CVs, research proposals, and funding applications and interview preparation.

### A-Level Tutoring

I provide tailored A-level tutoring in **Chemistry** and **Maths**. Possible sessions could focus on building understanding, confidence, and exam technique.

### Get in Touch

If you are interested in any of the above, the easiest next step is simply to get in touch. We can discuss your needs, rates, and decide together on the most appropriate way to move forward.

Please feel free to contact me via the **[Contact](/contact/)** page.

*I provide independent advice and am not affiliated with any university admissions process.*
