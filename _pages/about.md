Hello! My name is Sam (pronouns: they/them) and I am a researcher at the University of Cambridge working jointly between the [Gershlick Lab](https://www.gershlicklab.com/) and the Lee Lab. In my research, I develop new types of fluorescence microscopy, specifically focussing on 3D super-resolution microscopy.
