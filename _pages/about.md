Sam Daly (pronouns: they/them) has a background in chemistry and is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Gershlick Lab (Cambridge Institute for Medical Research) and the Lee Lab (Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry) at the University of Cambridge. Their research seeks to develop new approaches in 3D single-molecule localisation microscopy and single molecule tracking to better understand fundamental cell biology. 

Sam obtained their MChem degree from the University of York in 2020. Their master's thesis was supervised by Dr. Martin Cockett and used Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Ionisation (REMPI) spectroscopy to probe the weak interactions between biomolecules. Next, Sam obtained their PhD in Chemistry from the University of Cambridge in 2024. Their PhD project was supervised by Prof. Steven F. Lee and focussed on the development of novel single molecule microscopy methods. Shortly after, Sam was awarded an Impact Acceleration Award (BBSRC Pump-Priming 2024) to continue the development of Single Molecule Light Field Microscopy (SMLFM). In 2025, Sam was awarded a BBSRC Responsive Mode Grant as a named postdoctoral researcher to apply SMLFM to unravel the physical chemistry behind protein secretion in mammalian cells.
