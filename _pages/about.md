Hello! My name is Sam (pronouns: they/them) and I am a researcher at the University of Cambridge. I work jointly between the [Gershlick Lab](https://www.gershlicklab.com/) and the [Lee Lab](https://lee.group.ch.cam.ac.uk/), where I develop new types of 3D super-resolution microscopy to understand fundamental molecular processes in cells. Research is expensive and I am incredibly fortunate to have been supported in my research through two key grants: a BBSRC Impact Acceleration Award (2024), and a UKRI Responsive Mode Award (2025&ndash;2028). 

I earned my MChem in Chemistry at University of York in 2020, conducting my final year master’s project in [Physical Chemistry](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/research/physical/). I then obtained my PhD in Chemistry from the University of Cambridge in 2024 where I developed novel advanced microscopy technologies. 

Communicating the science I do is a key part of my job. Usually this is through writing up my research in peer-reviewed journals, but I also spend much of my time doing teaching and outreach. Some snapshots include delivering the undergraduate chemistry laboratory course, co-organising the Cambridge Microscopy Meeting, writing for the [Chemistry Review Magazine](https://magazines.hachettelearning.com/magazines/chemistry-review/?campaignid=23178995507&adgroupid=&adid=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23183318317&gbraid=0AAAAADekf7X9YVmuR5kVOjrBkV4OvaJMl&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDmzeykYa5AlckK3tBEqiTJg11_bRZl2B_uWl6yCx6JzxJDYRYyKqyhoCzakQAvD_BwE/) as a sub-editor, and founding the [Cambridge Queer in Chemistry Network](https://rescult.ch.cam.ac.uk/lgbtq-groups/).
