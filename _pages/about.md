Hello! My name is Sam (pronouns: they/them) and I am a researcher at the University of Cambridge. I work jointly between the [Gershlick Lab](https://www.gershlicklab.com/) and the [Lee Lab](https://lee.group.ch.cam.ac.uk/), where I develop new types of 3D super-resolution microscopy to understand fundamental molecular processes in cells.  

I earned my MChem in Chemistry at University of York in 2020, conducting my final year master’s project in [Physical Chemistry](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/research/physical/). I then obtained my PhD in Chemistry from the University of Cambridge in 2024 where I developed novel advanced microscopy technologies. 

Research is expensive! I am incredibly fortunate to have been supported in my research through two key grants: a BBSRC Impact Acceleration Award (2024), and a UKRI Responsive Mode Award (2025&ndash;2028).
