Hello! My name is Sam (pronouns: they/them) and I am a researcher at the University of Cambridge. I work jointly between the [Gershlick Lab](https://www.gershlicklab.com/) and the [Lee Lab](https://lee.group.ch.cam.ac.uk/), where I develop new types of 3D super-resolution microscopy to understand fundamental molecular processes in cells.
